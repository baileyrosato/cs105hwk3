One of my favorite TV shows is Psych.
The basis of the show is that two childhood best friends work together to solve crimes as consultants for the Santa Barbara police department.
One of the characters is hyper observant and uses his ability to notice things that others don't as being a Psychic.
I would definitely suggest watching it if you are looking for a fun detective comedy with lots of 80's references.

Let me know what show(s) are your favortie.
